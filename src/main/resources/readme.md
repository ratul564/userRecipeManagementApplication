  I created a spring boot project name user recipe management application. With the help of this project user can 
  find out recipe which is present in restaurant. Otherwise restaurant team can add new food recipe remove food 
  recipe from menu card, then customer can get all the food list. In this generation it will help full for busy people.
  They can see all the recipe from home.
